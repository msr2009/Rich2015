These are scripts from 

<b>Matthew S Rich, Celia Payen, Alan F Rubin, Giang Ong, Maitreya J Dunham, and Stanley Fields. "Functional annotation of the SUL1 promoter at single base resolution." JOURNAL (2015?)</b>

Included in this repository are:

`enrich/` -- this folder contains scripts from the Enrich software package which were used to all initial analyses of barcode counts. These scripts are preliminary versions of the Enrich software published in [1], which have more complex normalization and regression functionality.

`plot_heatmap_enrich2.py` -- this script takes output of enrich's barcode frequency analysis and creates the plots found in the Figure 2.

`enumerate_sequences.py` -- this script enumerates all single mutations of a given sequence, and was used to create the <em>in silico</em> sequences used for cryptic transcription factor binding site analysis (Figure X).

Raw reads used in the analyses in this manuscript can be found at SRA NNN.
